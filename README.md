# Basic JavaScript sintax.

With solving this problems, I practice working with JS basic sintax.

## Problem: Largest 3 Numbers
Write a program to read an array of numbers and find and print the largest 3 of them
### Example:
#### input:
solve(['10', '30', '15', '20', '50', '5'])
#### output:
50

30

20
## Problem: Sums Town
You are given a sequence of JSON strings holding town + income.
Write a JS function to sum and print the incomes for each town.
### Example:
#### input:
{"town":"Sofia","income":200}

{"town":"Varna","income":120}

{"town":"Pleven","income":60}

{"town":"Varna","income":70}
### output:
Pleven -> 60

Sofia -> 200

Varna -> 190




## Problem: Three Integers Sum
You are given 3 integers
Check whether two of them are equal to the third
Print the output in format a + b = c (a â‰¤ b)
### Example:
#### input:
solve(['8 15 7
'])
#### output:
7+8=15
## Problem: Upper Case Words
Write a JavaScript function to extract from array of strings all capital-case words. All non-letter chars are considered separators.
### Example:
#### input:
We start by HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON and REST.
Later we touch some PHP, MySQL and SQL.
Later we play with C#, EF, SQL Server and ASP.NET MVC.
Finally, we touch some Java, Hibernate and Spring.MVC.
#### output:
HTML, CSS, JSON, REST, PHP, SQL, C, EF, SQL, ASP, NET, MVC, MVC
